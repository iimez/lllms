## lllms

Libraries and server to build AI applications doing local inference in node. Use it within your application, or as a microservice. Adapters to [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/) via [node-llama-cpp](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp) and [gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all). And [transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/) using [ONNX](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/main/js#onnxruntime-node)!

The project includes a model resource pool, an inference queue and a HTTP API server. Model file management is abstracted away as much as possible - configure a URL and go. This package is useful for quick model evaluations and experiments (in JavaScript), small-scale chatbots, resource efficient assistants on edge devices, or any applications where private & offline are interesting criteria. For other - not node-based solutions - check out the [related solutions](#related-solutions) section.

⚠️ This package is currently in beta. APIs may change. Things may break. [Help is welcome](#contributing).

### Features

- Configure as many models as you want, they will be downloaded and cached on demand to `~/.cache/lllms`. You may provide them as abs file paths if you already have models downloaded.
- Adjust the pool `concurrency`, and the models `maxInstances`, `ttl` and `contextSize` to fit your usecase. Combine multiple pools for more complex setups.
- Can be tuned to either use no resources when idle or to always keep a model ready with context preloaded.
- A chat session cache that will effectively reuse context across multiple turns or stateless requests.
- OpenAI spec API endpoints. See [HTTP API docs](./docs/http-api.md) for details. A "native" HTTP API is not yet implemented.
- BYO web server or use the provided express server and middleware. Incoming requests are queued - stall, if needed - and processed as soon as resources are available.
- Have as many ModelServers running as you want, they can share the same cache directory. (Multiple processes can as well)
- Use the [ModelPool](./examples/pool.js) class directly for a lowerlevel transaction-like API to aquire/release model instances.
- Use [custom engines](./docs/engines.md#custom-engines) to combine multiple models (or do RAG) behind the scenes.

### Usage

Example with minimal configuration:

```ts basic.ts
import { ModelServer } from 'lllms'

const llms = new ModelServer({
  log: 'info', // default is 'warn'
  models: {
    'my-model': { // Identifiers can use a-zA-Z0-9_:\-\.
      // Required are `task`, `engine`, `url` and/or `file`.
      task: 'text-completion', // text-completion models can be used for chat and text generation tasks
      engine: 'node-llama-cpp', // each engine comes with a peer dep. `npm install node-llama-cpp@3`
      url: 'https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/smollm-135M-instruct-v0.2-Q8_0-GGUF/blob/main/smollm-135m-instruct-add-basics-q8_0.gguf',
    },
  },
})
await llms.start()
const result = await llms.processChatCompletionTask({
  model: 'my-model',
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Why are bananas rather blue than bread at night?',
    },
  ],
})
console.debug(result)
llms.stop()
```

Or, to start an OAI compatible HTTP server with two concurrent instances of the same model:

```ts http-api.ts
import { startHTTPServer } from 'lllms'
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const server = await startHTTPServer({
  listen: { port: 3000 }, // apart from `listen` options are identical to ModelServer
  concurrency: 2, // two inference processes may run at the same time
  models: {
    'smollm': {
      task: 'text-completion',
      engine: 'node-llama-cpp',
      url: 'https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/smollm-135M-instruct-v0.2-Q8_0-GGUF/blob/main/smollm-135m-instruct-add-basics-q8_0.gguf',
      maxInstances: 2, // two instances of this model may be loaded into memory
      device: {
        cpuThreads: 4, // limit cpu threads so we dont occupy all cores
      }
    },
  },
})

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/openai/v1/',
  apiKey: 'yes',
})
const completion = await client.beta.chat.completions.stream({
  stream_options: { include_usage: true },
  model: 'smollm',
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'lets count to 10, but only whisper every second number' },
  ],
})
for await (const chunk of completion) {
  if (chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0].delta.content)
  }
}
server.stop()
```

More usage examples:
- Using all available options / model options API doc [./examples/all-options](./examples/all-options.js).
- Custom engines [./tests/engines/experiments.test.ts](./tests/engines/experiments.test.ts).
- A chat cli [./examples/chat-cli](./examples/chat-cli.js).
- `concurrency` behavior [./examples/concurrency](./examples/concurrency.js).
- Using the ModelPool directly [./examples/pool](./examples/pool.js).
- Using the express middleware [./examples/express](./examples/express.js).

Currently supported inference engines are:

| Engine | Peer Dependency |
| --- | --- |
| node-llama-cpp | `node-llama-cpp >= 3.0.0` |
| gpt4all | `gpt4all >= 4.0.0` |
| transformers-js | `@huggingface/transformers >= 3.0.0` |

See [engine docs](./docs/engines.md) for more information on each.

#### Limitations and Known Issues

##### Only one model can run on GPU at a time
Llama.cpp bindings currently do not support running multiple models on gpu at the same time. This can/will likely be improved in the future. See [GPU docs](./docs/gpu.md) for more information on how to work around that.

##### System Messages
System role messages are supported only as the first message in a chat completion session. All other system messages will be ignored. This is only for simplicity reasons and might change in the future.

##### Chat Context Cache / Reusing the correct instance on stateless requests
Note that the current context cache implementation only works if (apart from the final user message) the _same messages_ are resent in the _same order_. This is because the messages will be hashed to be compared during follow up turns, to match requests to the correct session. If no hash matches everything will still work, but slower. Because a fresh context will be used and the whole input conversation will be reingested, instead of just the new user message.

##### Function Calling
Only available when using node-llama-cpp and a model that supports function calling. `tool_choice` can currently not be controlled and will always be `auto`. GBNF grammars cannot be used together with function calling.

##### Huge node_modules when installing all engines
CUDA binaries are distributed with each engine seperately, which leads to an extra 0.5-1GB of disk use. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about that.

### Contributing

If you are using this package - let me know where [you would like this to go](https://github.com/iimez/lllms/discussions). Code also welcome. You find things im planning to do (eventually) above, and the wishlist below.

#### Possible Future Goals

- See if it would make sense to implement engines for [leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) and [onnxruntime-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onnxruntime-node)
- Create a separate HTTP API thats independent of the OpenAI spec and stateful. See [discussion](https://github.com/iimez/lllms/discussions/8).
- Add a clientside library (React hooks?) for use of above API.
- Provide a Docker image. And maybe a Prometheus endpoint.
- Logprobs support for node-llama-cpp.

#### Currently not the Goals

- A facade to LLM cloud hoster HTTP API's. The strengths here are local/private/offline use.
- Worry too much about authentication or rate limiting or misuse. Host this with caution, it's likely DDoS-able.
- Some kind of distributed or multi-node setup. That should probably be something designed for this purpose from the ground up.
- Other common related tooling like vector stores, Chat GUIs, etc. Scope would probably get out of hand.
